## Description

This is a simple blog with Posts and Comments features.

On the Home page the latest posts are being rendered. You can open any post link to view the post text and the possible comments. If there are any comments you'll see the 'Comments' link, which can be clicked to show all comments.  Right next to it there is a 'Comment' button that allows to send a new comment for this post.

The navigation bar has a 'Write A Post' option, which allows you to create a new post.
